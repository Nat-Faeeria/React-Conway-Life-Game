# Rect-Conway-Life-Game
My own very basic and na√Øve implementation of Conway's life game in React.
I'm beginning with React, so things aren't optimised, but I'll try to improve this project.
Please criticize objectively

Run the game localy with npm start, or run the bundle script to build it.

A live version is hosted there : http://reactlifegame.ga/
